# tell me the exact problem

We are sorry for the inconvenience, but we are a little confused with your inquiry. Could you tell us if you are using any email clients for the account emilia@estudiojoplin.com.ar that causes the problem? Please explain the exact problem that is occurring from your side. So we can check more details about the problem.

Could you please check if emails appear in the webmail interface just like in the gmail interface?

We couldn't find any issues on the server side. There seems to be some configuration issue on the gmail side.

If you encounter the same problem in the webmail interface, let us know. So we can check it out further.

Best regards.
