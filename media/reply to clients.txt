    POP3 does not coordinate with the server. Messages marked as read/deleted/replied to in the mail application will not show up as such on the server. This means that future mail downloads with POP3 will show all messages as unread.

# exim syntax error


Hello Sir,

Upon checking we could see that your IP address was blocked on the server firewall due to Exim syntax errors. You can verify the same from the below log:
---------------------------
Exim syntax errors from 94.207.80.79 (-): 10 in the last 3600 secs - Blocked in csf port=587 [LF_EXIMSYNTAX]
---------------------------
I have unblocked the IP address now.

When you send emails from your Email client, please make sure that you have the mail address correct in the address box and ensure it doesn’t contain any special characters like quotations or any other special symbols around the email address.
When you have these symbols around the mail address, this will interpret as a strange character and the Email server doesn’t know how to handle it. It will mark this as a syntax error like we got in the log and will block the IP in the firewall. This will eventually produce connection error issues in the outlook or Email client.
In short, type the email address carefully and ensure there are no weird symbols or characters and that’s all, double-check everything before sending, that’s all, your mail will work fine.


Upon checking we could see that your IP address was blocked on the server firewall due to Exim syntax errors from the mailto:contact@quicklease.ae. You can verify the same from the below log:
---------------------------
Jul 19 13:47:47 server6 lfd[4118]: (eximsyntax) Exim syntax errors from 58.65.211.163 (-): 10 in the last 3600 secs - Blocked in csf port=587 [LF_EXIMSYNTAX]

I have unblocked the IP address now.

Please note that when you send emails from your Email client, please make sure that you have the mail address correct in the address box and ensure it doesn’t contain any special characters like quotations or any other special symbols around the email address.

Checking it we can see that the main domain is silher.com.ar pointing to the remote endpoint, also in regards to the subdomain tienda.silher.com.ar since the DNS of the domain is managed at the dreamhost endpoint. You need to update the A record with the IP of the new server (IP of the new server: 167.250.5.72).

Please check and let us know if you have any problems.

Best regards.

Sending an email that appears to have come from someone who did not send it is known as “forging email”. Any spammer can put any email address as the return address(in the FROM field) in their mail client such as Outlook Express.

Please note that there is nothing much a webhost can do to prevent this. What you can do the most is to setup filters for stopping the bounced mails from pouring in. I have set default address to "No such person at this address" so that all unrouteable mails to the domain will not be received in your inbox hereafter.
Make sure none of your email accounts are listed in plain text on your websites. And also you need to reset the email account password.

If you have any further questions or concerns, let us know. We are here 24/7 and always happy to help.
